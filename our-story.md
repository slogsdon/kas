Having fun and enjoying some time with friends, one never
imagines running into someone else who is marriage material,
let alone dateable, but this is exactly what happened to
two twenty-somethings one August evening during a chance
encounter.

Shane was out with a couple of his friends from college,
hanging out on the patio of a local restaurant. One of
those friends invited some workmates out to join them,
but nothing had been set in stone quite yet.

Kristine was stuck at work, taking care of the children
on her unit. Her phone buzzes. "Come hang out with us."
Soon after, Kristine found herself able to leave work
early and decided to join her fellow employee out on
the town.

Lo and behold, Shane's friend and Kristine's coworker
is the same person, and the two spend some time teaming
up against Shane's friends in a late-night game of
cornhole. To those watching, it was as if they had been
teammates for years, winning each game that they played.

As they say, from there the rest is history.

Here they are. She, the enthusiastic extrovert. He, the
calm introvert. Kristine and Shane are two peas in a pod
while still showing that opposites _do_ attract.
